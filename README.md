### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kostas and I am a software engineer with over 13 years of professional experience in web development, cloud computing and DevOps. My first line of code was on an Amstrad 6128 computer when I was 12 years old, and I never stopped coding ever since. I graduated top of my class in my Computer Science BSc and earned my MSc in Adv. Software Engineering with honours. 

I have a track record of solving complex problems with high quality software and passionately reducing toil by automation. I am also a force multiplier and help others grow professionally through mentoring, presenting, and blogging about lessons learned over my career, my lifelong learning journey.
