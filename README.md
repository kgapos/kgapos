### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kostas and I am a software engineer with 20 years of experience in web development, cloud computing, blockchain and DevOps. I wrote my first line of code in 1997 on an Amstrad 6128 computer, and I never stopped coding ever since. I graduated top of the 2003 class in my Computer Science BSc and earned my MSc in Adv. Software Engineering with distinction. 

I have a proven track record of cutting down on operational toil and solving complex problems with high quality software. Beyond coding, I enjoy elevating others in their professional journey through mentoring, presenting, and blogging.
